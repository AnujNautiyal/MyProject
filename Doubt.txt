1) I am firing same query from Db many time how to optimize. Where should I keep data in cache or session variable.
2) When to clear session.
3) When to stop request and response, and is it ok to redirect, as I have used it heavily.
4) When to connect and disconnect mysql. And if there are many user how to mantain them
5) I have to get data from different table, how to do it parallely and give to UI when done. Right now I am getting data parallely then waiting for all data to come then showing it. I want to do get data from table A shows, get data from Table B shows and so on.
5) For calling function in series, what to use next() or callback.
	ex:- app.get("Route", function(){
		A();
	     });
	     
	    OR

	    app.get("route",A);
6)
